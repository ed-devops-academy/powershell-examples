## Practice Exercise1: File Operations/Searching/Basic PowerShell Operators
<hr/>


**1.)** Create a folder TestingPurpose and 3 Subfolders inside it SubFolder1, SubFolder2

**2.)** Create some test files inside these folders:

* **TypeATest1.txt**, **TypeATest2.txt**  … **TypeATest50.txt** into **SubFolder1**
* **TypeBTest51.txt**, **Purpose52Test2.txt** … **TypeBTest100** into **SubFolder2**

    *Needless to say that you have to use logic for creating these files. Not one by one*

**3.)** Move all files which have an odd number in its name to SubFolder2

**4.)** Move all files which have even number in its name to SubFolder1

**5.)** Rename folder SubFolder1 to EvenFilesContainer and SubFolder2 to OddFilesContainer

**5.)** Prepare a list of all files currently existing inside folder TestingPurpose

**Example:** MasterFile.txt:

As of YYYYMMDD HH: MM files inside Testing Purpose are:

```
C:\testingPurpose\EvenFilesContainer\TypeBTest2.txt

.

.

C:\testingPurpose\OddFilesContainer\TypeATest99.txt
```
**6.)** Delete all files which start with TypeA
